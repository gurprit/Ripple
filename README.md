# ðŸŒŠ Ripple

**Ripple** is a positive, wholesome social media concept designed to spread kindness.  
Users post good deeds they've done â€” or good deeds done *for* them â€” and tag friends to keep the ripple going.

This is a personal side project built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**, exploring modern front-end development practices, clean component architecture, and positivity-driven user experience.
